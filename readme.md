# Boids

An experiment using three.js and typescript to implement an efficiently built 3D flocking simulation.

The flying objects will use three principles outlined by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)

## Build

The project can be built with the typescript compiler, requires typescript to be installed on your machine, or taken directly from the build output app.js

```javscript
tsc
